        <p id="info">HTML, once only released as specific versions, is now the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group's (WHAT Working Group) “living standard”.  
          This means that while it is a possibility that further versions, such as HTML 6.0, may be released in the future, HTML 5.0 was specifically designed to be continuously updated
          over time, rather than through traditional updates, allowing it adaptability and flexibility. WHAT Working Group's ability to update HTML over time has been 
          crucial in a time when the Web's advancements and features users require are changing so rapidly. This change from a once static HTML is now living alongside our day-to-day 
          advancements and changes, advancing and changing with them. The World Wide Web Consortium, W3C, was once the sole organization responsible for maintaining HTML and preffered to follow the traditional 
          process of individual versions being released. WHAT Working Group was created in 2004 and wanted to open HTML up to faster development 
          and advancements by introducing HTML as a living standard. For years, W3C and WHAT Working Group worked separately, resulting separate, differing HTML 
          standards. In 2019, an agreement was reached between the two, consolidating HTML development under WHATWG, giving us the HTML living standard that we know today. This agreement  
          ensured a singular standard, while still giving W3C the opportunity to work on the development of HTML. This agreement proved that W3C and WHAT Working Group saw a current and future 
          potential of harm if they continued to have two separate standards, further reinforcing HTML's foundational stability.</p>
          <p id="info">Markup languages are essential for the creation and structuring of web pages, data storage, documentation, and so much more. These languages allow for readability and a clear 
            standard in the use of tags, providing clarity to not only the systems reading the code, but also to other users who need to understand it as well. HTML is not to be 
            confused with a programming language such as C, Java, or Python. Although it lays the foundation for delivering the information on the website from the server to the client, 
            it doesn't meet the requirements of a programming language. An article from GeeksforGeeks explains the difference best, “HTML is all about defining the structure and layout 
            of a webpage, focusing on elements like headers, paragraphs, and images. Unlike programming languages, it doesn't control logic, behavior, or perform calculations. Its role is 
            to organize content, not execute operations or interact with data in real time” (GeeksforGeeks 2024). HTML defines the structure and layout of webpages by using specific markup 
            codes, which each represent an HTML element. Some of HTML's basic elements include the element &lt;p&gt;, which defines the beginning of a paragraph, &lt;hr&gt;, or horizontal rule, 
            defining a thematic break, &lt;br&gt;, defining a line break, and &lt;pre&gt;, defining preformatted text. The standard of HTML is an opening, parent &lt;tag&gt; with content 
            intended to be displayed within an ending with the closing, represented by a “/”, parent &lt;/tag&gt;. Within these parent tags, there can be child tags, but all child tags must have 
            their ending tag before the parent tag can end. </p>

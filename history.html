        <ul>
            <li> Who created HTML?
                <p> HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee while working at CERN(the European Organization for Nuclear Research).
                    His work at CERN inspired his idea for the web which, with the growth of the internet, hypertext, and 
                    the creation of the DNS, went hand in hand with HTML.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> When was HTML created?
                <p> Tim Berners-Lee began his idea of HTML in the late 1980's,
                    but it didn't become a reality until 1991 when the first version was introduced,
                    with HTML 1.0 following behind being officially released in 1993.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li> How many version of HTML have there been?
                <p> There have been six key HTML versions, each building upon the last, with the most recent being HTML 5.
                    Those key versions are as follows:
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>HTML Version</th>
                            <th>Release year and description</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>HTML 1.0</td>
                            <td>1991; First HTML version, limited elements and use.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>HTML 2.0</td>
                            <td>1995; Addition of more elements, introduction of forms, and it became
                                first HTML version to become the standard in the creation and design of websites.
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>1997; Became the new standard, Dave Ragget revised and improved HTML, but was later found to have
                                many issues slowing down browsers with the use of improvements.
                            </td>

                            <td>1999; Most successful HTML version up to this point, improving multimedia elements, supporting style sheets through CSS and
                                JavaScript. It became the standard markup language for web development from 2000-2012.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>HTML 4.01</td>
                            <td>2012; Improved upon HTML 4.0 and replaced it as the standard markup language for web development until 2014.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>HTML 5</td>
                            <td>2014; The curent HTML version and standard markup language for web development. </td>
                        </tr>

        <p id="info">Starting alongside Tim Berners-Lee's creation of the Web in the late 1900s, HTML became and has always been interconnected with the creation, development,
            and future of the Web. HTML had to quickly evolve to keep up with the quickly changing and demanding web and its developers and users. HTML has been the 
             foundation of the majority of the web, and almost everything has been built upon it, with an estimated 96.9% of all websites, of which we know what markup 
             language was used, being made using HTML. Gaining its popularity in the early 2000s with HTML version 4.0, HTML has only grown in its popularity and use under 
             the current version 5.0. Now, as a “living standard” under the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group  (WHAT Working Group) and the World Wide Web 
             Consortium (W3C), HTML version 5.0 continues to be updated and adapted to the demands of the ever changing web. HTML continues to be a crucial part of the Web 
             and its hard to imagine a world without it. </p>
        <h3>Future of HTML</h3>
        <p id="info">Seeing how intricate a piece HTML has been and continues to be in the Web, it is hard to see a future where it won't continue to be a part of. As the content we 
            consume and create changes, HTML will have to evolve alongside it. Although no one knows exactly what the future holds for it, there are plenty of predictions. 
            As HTML develops, it is very likely that we will see even more game development within it, as it supports multiple platforms, such as PC  or mobile gaming. The 
            evolution of HTML 5.0 features, such as geolocation, will also be an interesting feature to follow, as the extent of its uses could be endless. With the massive 
            growth of AI within the past few years, that will be a crucial space to follow and understand how it interconnects with HTML. Concerning the future of the offered 
            features within HTML will have to be able to handle the addition and embedding of AI features such as chatbots, voice, and facial recognition. Although the future 
            of HTML isn't completely known, as the world of web development grows and changes so quickly, the speculation and conversation of possibilities and needs continues.</p>
